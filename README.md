## Notes

You will need to do npm install react-router-dom and npm install recharts for the project to work properly, on top of the initial npm install when setting up the react project. 

Creating graphs was a new topic so it took a while to understand it. Nesting Routes was also a novel topic at the time of this project but it was interesting to see it in action. Furthermore, navigating the API properly was generally the main struggle/time consuming portion.
